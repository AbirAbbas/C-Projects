************
Compilation
************
make - compiles main.c

make test - compiles testMain.c

***********************
Running the program(s)
***********************
to run main.c do ./bin/program (fileName)

if no fileName was specified, user will be prompted to enter fileName within the program!

to run testMain.c do ./bin/testProgram

*****************
Known Limitations
*****************
All entered inputs will automatically be converted to lowercase, so user cannot keep track of
upper and lowercase values!

file must exist for the program to work!
*****************
Important
*****************
Hash algorithm used = 
It runs in a loop through the amount of characters in the strang (i to strlen(string))
it takes the ASCII character value of the current char and multiplies by the index it is located in
so ASCII(char) * index
Then it sums all iterations for every character in the string
and the sum is the key
and the index is key % size

All entry is converted to lower case
Example : Potato will be written as potato in the list!
